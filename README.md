# CMOOR Website Template

This is a template for C-MOOR students to use to create their own portfolio websites.  It enables students to create a professional website which they can manage through the GitHub GUI (no need to install or render anything locally).

- Uses the [Hugo setup](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) actions to render a Hugo static site hosted with GitHub pages.
- Theme was forked from [lxndrblz/anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/) and modified by Katherine Cox for use by C-MOOR learners.

This template uses the Hugo static site generator, so students interested in further customization can consult the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/) and dive as deep as they like into web development :)

## Create GitHub Account

To use this template, you must have a GitHub account.  If you do not yet have an account, this video ([video](https://link.c-moor.org/video-join-github))([slides](
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c4sb5CLpvKjgnTVIuNGYTSr8WWNgeSfC8TUGrxktu64/)) shows you how to create an account.  You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below.

1. Open [github.com](https://github.com/) in a web browser and click “Sign up”.
1. Choose a username and password.  It is a good idea to choose a username that you would not mind sharing with future employers, as they may view your GitHub profile.  Some good options include your name, or some variation of it, or something to do with the type of projects you’re working on.
1. GitHub will ask you a few questions and then ask you to choose a plan.  Unless you’re sure you need something from the paid plans, select the free plan.  You can always upgrade later.
1. Check your email and click on the verification link.
1. Update your GitHub profile.
    - You can access your GitHub profile from the dropdown menu on the right side of the screen, by clicking on your user icon.
    - It’s generally a good idea to add a little bit of information about yourself, so people can see who you are and verify they’re connecting with the right person.  From your profile page, you can upload a picture and enter some basic information about yourself.  This information will be public, so enter whatever information you’d like others to be able to see.

## Setup Website

The first steps in creating your website are to:

1. Create your own copy of this template,
1. Configure the settings so it runs in your GitHub repository
1. Confirm that when you make edits to the content, your website updates to reflect those changes

This video ([video](https://link.c-moor.org/video-student-website-setup))([slides](
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13chl2zYU1NbWCZmD_daqiKcLoJZAtILMqjXgew3TR6c/)) shows you how to set up your own copy of the website with some example content.  You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below.

### Copy Template

First, you need to create your own copy of the website template.

1. Find the [C-MOOR website template]() on GitHub.  Click the green “Use this template” button  to make your own copy.
    - This will open up a page for setting up your new project.  On GitHub, projects are called “repositories”.
1. Choose a name for your new repository.  This name will be part of the URL for your website, so it’s a good idea to make it short and descriptive.
    - You can change it later, but it’s a bit of a pain, so try to pick something that you will stick with.  You can also add a short description if you would like.
1. If you are using the free GitHub plan, you must choose Public for your website to work.
1. Click the “Create repository from template” button.

You should now have your own copy of the website repository (source code) that you can edit as you please, though it won't yet look like a website.  

### Configure Settings

The next step is to set things up so that this collection of files gets turned turn into a proper website.

### Confirm You Can Edit

## Personalize Website
